# Data Integration Pipelines for NYC Payroll Data Analytics
This project implements an ETL pipeline in Azure Data Factory to extract, transform and load the NYC finance dataset used in the [UDacity Data Engineering with Microsoft Azure](https://www.udacity.com/enrollment/nd0277/2.0.19) nanodegree project. The analytics outcome will accomplish the following objectives:
  1. Analyze how the City's financial resources are allocated and how much of the City's budget is being devoted to overtime.
  2. Make the data available to the interested public to show how the Cityâ€™s budget is being spent on salary and overtime pay for all municipal employees.
